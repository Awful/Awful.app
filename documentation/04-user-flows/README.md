## Flow Categories

### Core Workflows

### Secondary Workflows
Supporting features that enhance the user experience.

### Edge Cases
Unusual scenarios and error states that require special handling.

### Custom Behaviors
Unique interactions that differ from standard iOS patterns.

## Migration Principles

When converting flows to SwiftUI:

1. **Preserve Behavior**: Maintain exact user experience
2. **Document Differences**: Note any changes from standard patterns
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all edge cases work correctly
4. **Maintain Performance**: Ensure smooth interactions
5. **Respect Accessibility**: Preserve VoiceOver and other accessibility features

## Testing User Flows

For each documented flow:
- Create test scenarios
- Document expected behaviors
- Note error conditions
- Verify accessibility
- Test on different devices
