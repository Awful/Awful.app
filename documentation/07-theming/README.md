# Theming System Documentation

## Overview

Awful.app features one of the most sophisticated theming systems in iOS development, with support for:
- **Forum-specific themes** (YOSPOS, FYAD, etc.)
- **Automatic light/dark mode switching**
- **CSS integration with native UI**
- **Real-time theme updates**
- **Hierarchical theme inheritance**

This documentation is **critical** for the SwiftUI migration as the theming system must be fully replicated.

### üè∞ Forum Context
Themes can be overridden per forum, creating unique experiences for different communities.

### üìù CSS Integration
Native UI elements use CSS values for consistent styling between web content and native components.

## SwiftUI Migration Priority

The theming system is **high priority** for SwiftUI migration because:
1. Custom themes are a defining feature of Awful.app
2. Users rely on forum-specific theming
3. CSS integration affects post rendering
4. Real-time updates are expected behavior
