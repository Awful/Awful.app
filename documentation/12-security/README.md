## Security Principles

### Privacy First
- **No Analytics**: App doesn't collect user analytics
- **No Tracking**: No third-party tracking
- **Local Data**: All user data stored locally
- **Minimal Collection**: Only collect necessary data

### Secure by Design
- **HTTPS Only**: All network communication encrypted
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data in Keychain
- **Session Management**: Proper cookie handling
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user input

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Layers**: Several security mechanisms
- **Fail Secure**: Default to secure state
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions required
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current

## Current Security Measures

### Authentication
- Cookie-based authentication with Something Awful
- Secure cookie storage in system cookie jar
- Automatic session expiry handling
- Remote logout detection

### Data Protection
- Local Core Data encryption
- Keychain storage for sensitive data
- No cloud sync of personal data
- Complete data clearing on logout

### Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Certificate validation
- Network request monitoring
- Secure image loading

## Migration Security Considerations

### Preserve Security Model
- Maintain current authentication approach
- Keep data storage patterns
- Preserve privacy practices
- Maintain security boundaries

### Enhancement Opportunities
- Add biometric authentication
- Implement certificate pinning
- Enhanced input validation
- Improved error handling

### Risk Assessment
- Identify new attack vectors
- Review third-party dependencies
- Audit data flows
- Test security boundaries
