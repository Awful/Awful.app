### iOS System Integrations
- **[Keyboard Extension](keyboard-extension.md)** - Smilie keyboard extension with App Group sharing
- **[URL Schemes](url-schemes.md)** - Deep linking and custom URL handling
- **[Universal Links](universal-links.md)** - Web-to-app linking via associated domains
- **[Share Extension](share-extension.md)** - iOS share sheet integration and custom activities
- **[Handoff](handoff.md)** - Continuity support across devices

## Security Considerations

All integrations follow iOS security best practices:
- Keychain storage for sensitive tokens
- App Group sandboxing for shared data
- Proper entitlements configuration
- Privacy-preserving implementations

## Configuration Requirements

Most integrations require proper configuration:
- Imgur client ID in build settings
- App Group identifiers in entitlements
- Team ID for code signing
- URL scheme registration

See individual integration documentation for specific setup requirements.

## Testing

Each integration includes testing strategies and considerations for development and debugging. Integration testing should cover:
- Network connectivity scenarios
- Authentication flows
- Error handling paths
- Cross-app communication
- URL scheme handling

## Migration Notes

When updating integrations, consider:
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Migration paths for stored data
- Changes to external API requirements
- iOS version compatibility
- Entitlements and configuration updates
