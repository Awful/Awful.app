# How to contribute to Awful

If you're unsure about any step here, please by all means come visit the [Awful app development and beta testing thread][awful-dev-thread] and say hi!

## I want to help test beta releases

Happy to have you aboard! Please send your email address (doesn't need to be associated with an Apple ID) to **pokeyman**, either by [private message](https://forums.somethingawful.com/private.php?action=newmessage) or by posting in the [Awful beta testing thread][awful-dev-thread]. We use TestFlight to distribute beta releases. We are nowhere near our limit on number of users, we will admit all comers.

## I found a bug

Please check [the Issues list on GitHub][github-issues] to see if it's been reported. Search around a little bit.

If you don't see your issue, please [open a new one](https://github.com/awful/Awful.app/issues/new) and describe what you found.

## I want a new feature

Please post in [the development thread][awful-dev-thread], or heck even in [the main thread][awful-thread]. We really don't mind duplicate requests! It helps us prioritize.

## I got a new square thread tag for ya

Awesome! Thread tags aren't exclusive to the iOS app so [they're in a separate repo](https://github.com/Awful/thread-tags#readme).

## Someone mentioned a bug in [the thread](awful-thread)

Please check [the Issues list on GitHub](github-issues) to see if it's been reported. Search around a little bit.

If you don't see your issue, please [open a new one](https://github.com/awful/Awful.app/issues/new) and quote the relevant bits from the post.

## I wrote come code

Open a GitHub pull request with your patch. Please reference any relevant GitHub issues.

Once you get a pull request accepted, you'll be invited to the repo as a collaborator.

It's always ok to open a PR even if you have the commit bit already!

## General issue policy

**Issues are closed when resolved.** Resolving an issue means at least one of:

* Describing a solution.
* Pushing fixed code (include the issue # in the commit message).
* Deciding not to fix the problem.

There is no meaningful limit on the number of open issues we can have here. There is no need to janitor that list to keep it "small" or "reasonable". If you're unwilling to deal with a particular issue (and that's ok!), please don't close it.
