/**

 Private header for ASDisplayNode.mm

 _ASPendingState is a proxy for a UIView that has yet to be created.
 In response to its setters, it sets an internal property and a flag that indicates that that property has been set.

 When you want to configure a view from this pending state information, just call -applyToView:
 */

@interface _ASPendingState : NSObject <ASDisplayNodeViewProperties, ASDisplayProperties>

// Supports all of the properties included in the ASDisplayNodeViewProperties protocol

- (void)applyToView:(UIView *)view;
- (void)applyToLayer:(CALayer *)layer;

@end
