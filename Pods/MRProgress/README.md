MRProgress is a collection of drop-in components that display a dimmed overlay with a blurred box view with an indicator and/or labels while work is being done in a background thread.

* **Component oriented**: You don't have to use all components or `MRProgressOverlayView`. You can use just the custom activity indicators or progress views.
* **Configurable**: All components implement tintColor.
* **Customizable**: You can replace the given blur implementation and hook into your own you are maybe already using in other places of your app. Or simply throw in an [UIToolbar's layer](https://github.com/mrackwitz/MRProgress/tree/uitoolbar_blur), if you prefer Apple's implementation. (Current blur implementation is as given by sample code of WWDC 2013.)
* **Reusable**: The code is fragmented in small reusable pieces.
* **Well documented**: You can install and open Appledoc documentation.
* **Integrated**: It offers an integration into [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking).
* **Accessible**: It provides labels, traits and events for UIAccessibility.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add MRProgress to your project.

1. Add a pod entry for MRProgress to your *Podfile* `pod 'MRProgress'`.
2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.
3. Include MRProgress wherever you need it with `#import <MRProgress/MRProgress.h>` from Objective-C or `import MRProgress` from Swift.


### Source files

1. Download the [latest code version](http://github.com/mrackwitz/MRProgress/archive/master.zip) or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project.
2. Drag and drop the **src** directory from the archive in your project navigator. Make sure to select *Copy items* when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project.
3. Include MRProgress wherever you need any component with `#import "MRProgress.h"` or include it in your bridging header to use it in Swift.


### Static library

1. Drag and drop **MRProgress.xcodeproj** in your project navigator.
2. Select your target and go to the *Build Phases* tab. In the *Link Binary With Libraries* section select the add button. On the sheet find and add libMRProgress.a.
3. Add Target **MRProgress** to your *Target Dependencies* list.
4. Use `import <MRProgress/MRProgress.h>` from Objective-C or `import MRProgress` from Swift wherever you want to use the components.


### Cocoapods - Subspecs

The library is cut in small subspecs, so that you can just depend on selected components. See the following dependency tree:

```
─┬─MRProgress/
 │
 ├───Blur
 │
 ├───ActivityIndicator
 │
 ├───Circular
 │
 ├───Icons
 │
 ├───NavigationBarProgress
 │
 ├─┬─Overlay
 │ ├───ActivityIndicator
 │ ├───Circular
 │ ├───Icons
 │ └───Blur
 |
 ├─┬─AFNetworking (optional)
 │ ├───ActivityIndicator
 │ ├───Circular
 │ ├───NavigationBarProgress
 │ └───Overlay
 |
 ├───MethodCopier (optional)
 │
 ├───MessageInterceptor (optional)
 │
 └───WeakProxy (optional)
```

The tree only list *public* specs, where you can rely on.
You will see in the podspec and your Podfile.lock other subspecs, but you should
*NOT* rely on these. Those are implementation details, which are subject to
change and may been removed, even with a minor version update.
Furthermore this tree doesn't show any cross-dependencies, which do exist.


## Requirements

* Xcode 5
* iOS 7
* ARC
* Frameworks:
    * QuartzCore
    * CoreGraphics
    * Accelerate



## Usage

Check out the provided demo app for many examples how you can use the components.
Make sure you also see [MRProgress documentation on Cocoadocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MRProgress/).

### Basics

1. Add the following import to the top of the file or to your Prefix header:

   ```objc
   // If used with Cocoapods
   #import "MRProgress.h"
   ```

   ```objc
   // If used as Framework
   #import <MRProgress/MRProgress.h>
   ```

2. Use one the following ways to display the overlay:

   ```objc
   // Block whole window
   [MRProgressOverlayView showOverlayAddedTo:self.window animated:YES];
   ```

   ```objc
   // Block only the navigation controller
   [MRProgressOverlayView showOverlayAddedTo:self.navigationController.view animated:YES];
   ```

   ```objc
   // Block only the view
   [MRProgressOverlayView showOverlayAddedTo:self.view animated:YES];
   ```

   ```objc
   // Block a custom view
   [MRProgressOverlayView showOverlayAddedTo:self.imageView animated:YES];
   ```

3. Simply dismiss after complete your task:

   ```objc
   // Dismiss
   [MRProgressOverlayView dismissOverlayForView:self.view animated:YES];
   ```

### AFNetworking

MRProgress offers an integration into the network library AFNetworking.

1. Include the following **additional** line into your Podfile:

   ```ruby
   pod 'MRProgress/AFNetworking'
   ```

2. Import the adequate category header for the component you want to use:

   ```objc
   #import <MRProgress/MRProgressOverlayView+AFNetworking.h>
   ```

3. You can now just setup your task / operation as usual and use the category
   methods to bind to execution state and progress as shown below.

   ```objc
   // Init the progress overlay as usual
   MRProgressOverlayView *overlayView = [MRProgressOverlayView showOverlayAddedTo:self.view animated:YES];

   // The following line will do these things automatically:
   // * Set mode to determinate when a download or upload is in progress
   // * Set animated progress of the download or upload
   // * Show a checkmark or cross pane at the end of the progress
   [overlayView setModeAndProgressWithStateOfTask:task];

   // Allows the user to cancel the task by using the provided stop button.
   // If you use that, make sure that you handle the error code, which will be
   // delivered to the failure block of the task like shown below:
   //
   //    if ([error.domain isEqualToString:NSURLErrorDomain] && error.code == NSURLErrorCancelled) {
   //        NSLog(@"Task was cancelled by user.");
   //        return;
   //    }
   //
   [overlayView setStopBlockForTask:task];

   // If you use the activity indicator directly
   [self.activityIndicatorView setAnimatingWithStateOfTask:task];

   // If you use one of the progress views directly
   [self.circularProgressView setProgressWithUploadProgressOfTask:downloadTask animated:YES];   // for uploads
   [self.circularProgressView setProgressWithDownloadProgressOfTask:downloadTask animated:YES]; // for downloads
   [[MRNavigationBarProgressView progressViewForNavigationController:self.navigationController]
     setProgressWithDownloadProgressOfTask:downloadTask animated:YES];
   ```

   All methods are available for both 'NSURLSessionTask' and 'AFURLConnectionOperation' and their descendants.
   For further examples, make sure to also checkout the [Example app](/blob/master/Example/MRAFNetworkingSupportViewController.m).

## Credits

MRProgress' API was inspired by [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD) project.

The acquarium image was stolen by [Jag Cesar's blur implementation](https://github.com/JagCesar/iOS-blur).
