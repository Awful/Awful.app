/**
 A custom URL protocol that intercepts certain Forums requests and loads fixture data in their place.
 
 This protocol is intentionally difficult to use in an effort to avoid ever shipping this protocol enabled to actual users (e.g. via the App Store). It is wrapped in an `#if DEBUG … #endif`, it requires futzing with target memberships, and it requires adding code somewhere in the app itself to actually do anything. Please do not commit any of these changes to the git repository!
 
 All that said, here's how you might use this thing:
 
 1. Go to Awful's AppDelegate.swift and find the application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method.
 2. Add a line pretty early on that resembles:
 
     FixtureURLProtocol.enabledFixtures = [.announcement, .forum]
 3. In Xcode's Project navigator, go find the Core/Tests/Fixtures folder reference and add it to the Core target.
 4. Build and run.
 
 This will intercept any requests to `forumdisplay.php` (i.e. to list the forums or the threads in a forum) and to `announcement.php` (i.e. to list the current announcements) and instead load the test fixture data in its place.
 
 Note that this URL protocol will do nothing in a WKWebView, which disallows custom futzing with http and https schemes.
