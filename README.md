# Awful

[Awful][App Store] is an iOS 9+ app that's *Better Than Safari* for browsing the [Something Awful Forums][forums]. Its story is told in [its thread][current thread] (and [its older thread][second thread] (and [its first thread][first thread])).

Not sure what to work on? There's a [list of issues](https://github.com/awful/Awful.app/issues), or just post in the thread and someone will share their pet peeves for your amusement!

## An unofficial app

This app is not endorsed by Something Awful.

## Build

You need Xcode 10 to build and run Awful. You can [download Xcode for free from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/). Then:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Awful/Awful.app Awful-app`
2. Open the Xcode workspace and build away: `xed Awful-app`

You may see build warnings of the form "Unable to find included file '../Local.xcconfig'". You should still be able to build and run, just with a couple of features turned off. If you'd like to enable those features, or just make the warnings go away, please scroll on down to the "Local build settings" section below.

There are no required dependencies for building Awful; all third-party libraries are included, and files generated by other utilities are included in the repository. The only submodule is the [thread-tags][] repository, which is not strictly needed for building; if you don't need it, you can leave off the `--recursive` part from step one.

If you'd like to build to your device, set the `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` build setting as mentioned in the Local build settings section below.

### Optional dependencies

There are optional dependencies for building Awful. You only need them if you're working on the relevant part of the app.

* [CocoaPods][] manages dependencies. If you're updating, adding, or removing a dependency, please [install CocoaPods][CocoaPods].
    * There's a `Gemfile` nearby if you want to use a known working version of CocoaPods.
    * **Even if you add a dependency directly to the Xcode project**, please update `App/Templates/Acknowledgements.html.stencil` with the name and license of the dependency. We do not use the CocoaPods-generated acknowledgements.
* [LESS][] helps us write CSS. If you're modifying the themes for displaying posts (these are files like `posts-view*.less`), please [install LESS][LESS]:
    1. [Install homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).
    2. Open Terminal and install node: `brew install node`.
    3. In Terminal, install less: `npm install less -g`.
    4. Now build the Xcode project and the CSS files will be regenerated.

[LESS]: http://lesscss.org/#usage

### Local build settings

There are some local build settings that can be useful to include but should not be committed to a public repo. Store those in an Xcode configuration file at `Local.xcconfig`; see [Local.sample.xcconfig](Local.sample.xcconfig) for an example. You'll get a build warning until you put a file at that location; it can be an empty file if you just want Xcode to be quiet.

Awful uses an App Group to communicate and share data with the Smilie Keyboard. Unfortunately, App Group identifiers must be unique, so I can't simply set it up and have everything work. By default, Awful builds without an App Group configured, which means that the Smilie Keyboard won't be able to download new smilies, remember recent smilies, or store favourite smilies. If you like, you can:

1. Create an App Group in your iOS Developer account.
2. Copy `Local.sample.entitlements` to `Local.entitlements`.
3. Copy and paste your App Group identifier into `Local.entitlements`.
4. Set the `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` build setting in `Local.xcconfig` for the targets `Awful` and `SmilieKeyboard` (see `Local.sample.xcconfig` for a suggested setup).
5. After a build and run, full keyboard functionality should be yours.

### Tests

There are unit tests for the HTML scraping, to help us find problems when markup changes, running continuously via [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/awful-app/Awful%20iOS/_build?definitionId=1).

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/awful-app/Awful%20iOS/_apis/build/status/Awful%20iOS?branchName=change-ci)](https://dev.azure.com/awful-app/Awful%20iOS/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

### Version scheme

Bump the major version when raising the iOS deployment target. Otherwise, bump the minor version.

Also, when raising the iOS deployment target, please tag the last commit that supports the no-longer-supported deployment target(s) and update the table in the section "iOS deployment targets" below.

### Handy utilities

If you peek in the [Xcode](Xcode) folder you'll find:

* `beta`, a script that bumps the build number and then runs `xcodebuild` to create an archive suitable for uploading to App Store Connect. See `beta --help` for more, including how to set up automatic uploads to App Store Connect.
    * If you've released to the App Store, it's time to bump at least the minor version number by passing the `--minor`  parameter, e.g. `beta --minor`.
* `bump`, a script that can increment the build, minor, or major version number throughtout the project. See `bump --help` for more.
* `scale-stickers`, a script that turns smilies into 3x images suitable for an iMessage sticker pack. You should probably run this after running the `SmilieExtractor` app.

And in the Xcode workspace itself you'll find:

* `SmilieExtractor`, an iOS app that takes `showsmilies.webarchive` and extracts resources for both Smilie Keyboard and Smilie Stickers. To update smilies, first save a fresh `showsmilies.webarchive` from the Forums, then run `SmilieExtractor`, then look at `scale-stickers`.

### Loading fixtures into the app and/or working offline

If you've stashed some .html files from the Forums, you can load those into a debug build of the app. And if you forgot to stash some, you're in luck: we've stashed some as test fixtures. See [FixtureURLProtocol](Core/Networking/FixtureURLProtocol.swift) for more info.

## Contribute

You can help! See our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Project Structure

Awful is broken down somewhat:

* `Awful` is the iOS app.
* `AwfulCore` is a framework that does the scraping and networking with the Forums. It's meant to be compatible with both iOS and OS X, but nobody's actually tried on OS X.
* `Smilies` is a framework that downloads smilies and presents them as a keyboard. It's meant to be compatible with both iOS and OS X, but nobody's actually tried on OS X.

### Data Flow

The [HTTP client][] connects to the Something Awful Forums and parses its contents, saving those contents as [entities in a Core Data store][entities]. Various screens show the forums, threads, posts, private messages, and users saved to the Core Data store.

Awful's Core Data store is a cache of content from the Forums. Any user info specific to the app is stored in [user defaults][]. The Core Data store may be (and can be, since it's stored in the application's Caches directory) deleted at any time.

[HTTP client]: Core/Networking/ForumsClient.swift
[entities]: Core/Model
[user defaults]: App/Settings/UserDefaults+Settings.swift

### Theming

Awful's [posts view][] is fully customizable using CSS. There's a [default theme][], as well as themes for specific forums such as [YOSPOS][YOSPOS CSS theme] and [FYAD][FYAD CSS theme]. Internally, we use LESS to generate our CSS, so if you are editing built-in themes please edit the `.less` files. (LESS installation instructions are above.) Then commit both the modified `.less` files and any resulting changes to `.css` files, so others don't need LESS to build Awful.

The rest of Awful is themed in a a [big plist][theme plist]. If you can't find a theme key you'd like to use, ask and we'll add it!

[posts view]: App/Posts/PostsView.swift
[default theme]: App/Theming/posts-view.css
[YOSPOS CSS theme]: App/Theming/posts-view-yospos.less
[FYAD CSS theme]: App/Theming/posts-view-fyad.less
[theme plist]: App/Theming/Themes.plist

### Thread Tags

[Diabolik900][] and [The Dave][] have fashioned Awful with its own [set of thread tags][thread tags] that look great on the iPhone and the iPad. They're distributed with the app. New thread tags can also [appear in Awful][AwfulThreadTags] without us having to send an update through the App Store. This is done by hosting the icons via [GitHub Pages][awfulapp.com.git].

To add a new thread tag you just made:

1. Add it to the [thread tags repository][Thread Tags.git] and push.
2. Update the [awfulapp.com repository][awfulapp.com.git] repository per [its README][awfulapp.com.git README].
3. In this (Awful.app) repository, update the `App/Resources/Thread Tags` submodule and push:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/awful-app/repo
    cd App/Resources/Thread\ Tags
    git pull origin master
    cd ..
    git commit -am "Updated thread tags."
    git push
    ```

### Alternate App Icons

As of iOS 10.3 alternate app icons are a thing. We have some lovely choices. Since Awful supports both iOS 10 and iOS 11, there's some hoops to jump through. Here's a mini checklist for adding a new alternate app icon:

* Pick a name for the alternate icon. The icon picker in the Settings tab sorts icons alphabetically by this name. (e.g. the :getout: frog is called `getout`.)
* Name the image files according to the scheme you see for the existing icons, but using your chosen name.
* Add new key and values to *both* `CFBundleIcons` and `CFBundleIcons~ipad`. Your added key/values will be identical between those two locations, so go ahead and copypasta.
* Add the image files to the Xcode project, and *double-check that the images get added to the target*. Seems like Xcode 9 doesn't always add everything even if you ticked the target on the sheet.

The reason for this silliness: iOS 10 requires alternate icons to be loose in the app bundle, while iOS 11 supports alternate icons in an asset catalog; iTunes Connect requires all submissions built using the iOS 11 SDK to have the main app icon in an asset catalog. It seems like the asset catalog compiler merges any `CFBundleIcons` values it comes across with its own generated values so it works out ok for us.

## URL schemes

Awful answers to a couple URL schemes:

* `awful:` opens Awful directly to various screens. This URL scheme is documented at http://handleopenurl.com and at [Launch Center Pro](http://actions.contrast.co).
    * `awful://forums` opens the Forums tab.
    * `awful://forums/:forumid` opens the Forums tab to the identified forum.
    * `awful://threads/:threadid` opens the first page of the identified thread. For example, `awful://threads/3510131` opens Awful's thread.
    * `awful://threads/:threadid/pages/:page` opens the given page of the identified thread. For example, `awful://threads/3510131/pages/15` opens the fifteenth page of Awful's thread.
    * `awful://posts/:postid` opens the identified post's page of its thread and jumps to it. For example, `awful://posts/408179339` opens the OP of Awful's thread.
    * `awful://bookmarks` opens the Bookmarks tab.
    * `awful://messages` opens the Messages tab.
    * `awful://messages/:messageid` opens the identified private message. (I guess the idea is to handle a link from one message to another? )
    * `awful://settings` opens the Settings tab.
    * `awful://users/:userid` opens the identified user's profile. For example, `awful://users/106125` opens pokeyman's profile.
    * `awful://banlist` opens the Leper's Colony.
    * `awful://banlist/:userid` opens the identified user's rap sheet. For example, `awful://banlist/106125` opens pokeyman's rap sheet.
* `awfulhttp:` and `awfulhttps:` handle Forums website URLs to any screens that have a corresponding `awful:` URL described above.
    * The idea is you take your `https://forums.somethingawful.com/…` URL, put `awful` in front, and now it opens in Awful.

## Stickers

There's an iMessage sticker pack with all the smilies. From a fresh start:

* Save a webarchive of the Forums's [showsmilies][] page in `Smilies/Tests/showsmilies.webarchive`.
* Build and run `Smilie Extractor` in the iOS simulator.
* Tap the `Stickers` button.
* Now run `make stickerscale` in Terminal.
* You're done.
