An unofficial app
-----------------

An official SA Forums app is in the works, and that official app is not this one. Awful is tolerated so long as

* we don't charge for it
* we remove the app from the App Store as soon as an official one arrives
* nobody complains to SA Forums staff when the app breaks, or their account breaks because of the app.

Please, if you put your own app derived from Awful on the App Store, abide by these same terms. Pretend we are lawyers and have written an iron-clad license requiring this.

Build
-----

1. Grab code: `git clone https://nolanw@github.com/regularberry/Awful.git`
2. Grab submodules: `cd Awful && git submodule update --init`
3. Open Xcode project and build away: `open Awful.xcodeproj`

Contribute
----------

We welcome any feedback, issues, or pull requests. Thanks!

License
-------

To be determined; something like BSD 2-clause with pleadings not to sell on the App Store?
