/**
 Scrapes the page shown after submitting the ignore list form.
 
 This is the page that usually redirects you back to the user control panel after submitting the ignore list.
 
 The scrape result can "succeed" by finding certain errors we expect to see, if that makes sense. For example, if we get a "user X is a moderator/admin" error, then `init(_:url:)` doesn't throw (we found something unsurprising), but the result is a `.failure` (because your ignore list didn't get updated).
