GRMustache
==========

GRMustache is an Objective-C implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) logic-less template language ([version 1.1.2](https://github.com/mustache/spec)).

The Mustache syntax: http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html (not wrong, but somewhat outdated).

A list of Mustache implementations in other languages: http://mustache.github.com/

How To
------

### 1. Download

    $ git clone https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.git

### 2. Add to your Xcode project

- For MacOS 10.6+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache3-MacOS.a` to your project.
- For iOS3+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache3-iOS.a` to your project.

### 3. Import "GRMustache.h" and start rendering templates

```objc
#import "GRMustache.h"

// Renders "Hello Arthur!"
NSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@"Arthur"]
                                            fromString:@"Hello {{name}}!"
                                                 error:NULL];

// Renders from a resource
NSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@"Arthur"]
                                          fromResource:@"Profile"  // loads `Profile.mustache`
                                                bundle:nil
                                                 error:NULL];
```

Documentation
-------------

GRMustache online documentation is provided as guides and sample code:

- [Guides/templates.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/templates.md): how to parse and render templates
- [Guides/runtime.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime.md): how to provide data to templates
- [Guides/delegate.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/delegate.md): how to hook into template rendering
- [Guides/sample_code.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code.md): because some tasks are easier to do with some guidelines.


FAQ
---

- **Q: How do I render array indices?**
    
    A: Check [Guides/sample_code/counters.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code/counters.md).

- **Q: How do I render default values for missing keys?**

    A: This can be done by providing your template a delegate: check [Guides/delegate.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/delegate.md).

- **Q: I have a bunch of template partials that live in memory, not in the file system. How do I include them?**
    
    A: Check [Guides/template_repositories.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/template_repositories.md).

- **Q: I provide false (zero) to a `{{#section}}` but it renders anyway?**
    
    A: That's because zero (the number) is not considered false by GRMustache. Consider providing an actual boolean, and checking the list of "false" values at [Guides/runtime/booleans.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime/booleans.md).

- **Q: What is this NSUndefinedKeyException stuff?**

    A: When GRMustache has to try several objects until it finds the one that provides a `{{key}}`, several NSUndefinedKeyException are raised and caught. Let us double guess you: it's likely that you wish Xcode would stop breaking on those exceptions. This use case is covered in [Guides/runtime/context_stack.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime/context_stack.md).


Contribution wish-list
----------------------

I wish somebody would review my non-native English, and clean up the guides, if you ask.
